            <h2>Ideation:</h2>

            <p>To get started with the design process I did some brainstorming sketches. I did this to experiment with different layout options, orientations, and text placement.</p>

            <p>During this phase I heavily considered how I wanted content to be displayed, with also keeping in mind how I would make my designs responsive.</p>

            <p>In the end I opted for a singular column layout to mimic a social media-like feed appearance, since this is a blog. This choice is more casual and easily adaptable to both mobile and desktop designs. </p>

            <h2>Mid-fi Prototype:</h2>

            <p>After making some further refinements to my sketches, I went ahead and developed my mid-fi prototype in Figma.</p>

            <p>During this stage I considered the design style I wanted to go for. This includes colors, typography, box styles, button styles, etc.</p>

            <p>Ultimately, I wanted a modern and minimalistic, yet bold design that showcased my personal artistic style.</p>

            <p>I decided on a bright peachy pink as the primary color throughout the site. And I used a elegant serif font for headers and a sans-serif font for body text. I used a drop shadow to add depth to the space and rounded edges for a friendly feel.</p>

            <h2>Critiques & Revisions:</h2>

            <p>After creating the mid-fi prototype, others critiqued my design and I made the appropriate changes.</p>
                
            <p>One person suggested I create a button for the "read more" link to bring more attention to that feature.</p>
            
            <p>Another person was concerned with the readability of the white text on the gradient backgrounds in the header and footer. I made changes to fit those needs and I also made some additional changes to add more interest in the design.</p>

            <h2>Prototyping: High-fi:</h2>

            <p>Once the desktop designs were finalized and I finished making the appropriate adjustments, I went ahead and developed the mobile design.</p>
                
            <p>This mobile design aimed to be readable at a smaller scale, but still carried the same components as the desktop version.</p>
            
            <p>I then used these mobile and desktop designs to guide the development process. I jumped right into Visual Studio Code to get started with coding.</p>

            <h2>Development Process:</h2>

            <p>I started the coding with mobile first to ease the complexity of the CSS. </p>
                
            <p>I ran into some issues with translating designs into the actual product. For example, having that simple pink border around each post on desktop posed to be a more difficult task than expected. Ultimately it had to be removed for optimal responsiveness.</p>
            
            <p>A factor that wasnâ€™t properly considered during the design process was the different styles of link states. As I was developing I needed to figure out the style and colors of links during hover, active, and visited states.</p>
