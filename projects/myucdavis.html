        <p>REDESIGN - myUCdavis<br>

        On paper, myUCdavis is a platform that can be used as a ‚Äúbase‚Äù to navigate to other websites UC Davis students use daily (Canvas, Schedule Builder, etc.) Despite this, it is rarely used by students across the board.</p>

            

        <p>üí° How might we boost myucdavis‚Äô usage and motivate users to utilize the platform so it can be used as it was originally intended?</p>

            <h2>Ideation:</h2>

            <p>To begin the design process each member participating in creating design sketches to get our ideas down on paper.</p>

            <p>We then combined our brainstorms together and identified common themes between our ideas which were: sidebar with links, uniformity with tile sizes and orientations, drop down menus, and reduction of visual content on main page.</p>

            <p>I also went ahead and did a user flow chart to understand how a user would search for content.</p>

            <p>I found that the two most used functions were the tiles and the top bar navigation meaning that those two features¬†needed to be designed in a way that was intuitive, simple, and easy to access.</p>

            <p>Otherwise, users may leave the site due to frustration or confusion.</p>

            <h2>Prototyping: Lo-fi Sketches</h2>

            <p>To begin the prototyping, we started with lofi-sketches. These were created based off the the idea we had combined from our brainstorms. Erika created the basic layout for the desktop and I created the stylistic direction for our designs.</p>

            <p>Based off of our user research, users wanted an interface that was clutter-free and easily navigatable.</p>

            <p>Because of that, the team and I kept clearity in mind when coming up with out inital designs.</p>

            <p>For our mid-fi prototype we¬†took ideas from our lo-fi sketches to start working on our final design.¬†We established margins between content,¬†standardized the widths and heights of tiles,¬†began working on a standardized layout of tiles, and¬†began implementing the customize view.</p>

                

            <p>We then made further developments to then conduct user testing on. We received helpful insight from our participants which helped us refine our final design.</p>

        <h2>Final Desktop Design:</h2>

        <p>The final redesign of myUCdavis aimed to be a user-friendly and intuitive site that encouraged users to comeback.</p>

        <p>The minimalistic design was implemented to reduce clutter and confusion. However, the minimal design still contains the necessary tools for UC Davis students.</p>

        <p>Maintaining the user's ability to customize the layout of their hub was also essential to making sure content was relevant to the user.</p>

        <h2>Improvements & Next Steps:</h2>

        <p>Due to time constraint, my team and I were unable to develop certain aspects of our design. Here are some improvements we would like to make:</p>

            

        <p>First off, we want to flesh out suggestions from user testing that we did not get to.</p>



        <p>This includes improving widget functionality and variety, having sidebar pop-ups expand to the side and expand by just hovering over it, and movability with the ordering of widgets.

        </p>



        <p>Secondly, we want to look at gathering more data from users and creating a mobile version of myUCdavis.</p>
